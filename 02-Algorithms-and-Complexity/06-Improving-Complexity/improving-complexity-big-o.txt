1. This algorithm uses an iterates over the collection and has O(n)
2. This is a version of merge sort which has O(n log n).  It is faster than a linear algorithm and also worst case of quick sort but requires more stack space when using arrays.
3. The last refactoring uses the quick sort algorithm which has O(n^2) but has a lower space complexity than merge sort since it sorts thearray in place instead of splitting up the array.
