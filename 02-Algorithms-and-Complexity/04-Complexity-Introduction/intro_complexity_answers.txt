Describe an analogy for relating an algorithm that has efficiency O(1) and another algorithm that has O(2n).

An algorithm that has O(1) is a lightening bolt and an algorithm that has O(2n) is a sloth.

In plain English, what is the best case scenario for binary search?

Best case scenario for a binary search is finding the item on the first iteration.

In plain English, what is the worst-case scenario for binary search?

The worst case for binary search is linear time meaning that however many items you have to search is the upper bound for time complexity.

In plain English, what is the bounded-case scenario for binary search?

The bounded case for binary search is logarithmic time.

Create a graph using the data below. Here's a CSV with the values you'll need.
What is the limit of the function above as n approaches infinity?

The limit is infinity.

What is the Big-O of an algorithm that has the data points above?

O(n^2)

Write a Ruby method that takes a number n. This method must print the worst-case number of iterations for linear search to find an item in collections of size one to n. Use it to generate a table of worst-case iterations of collections up to size 10.

Create a graph from the output using Google Sheets or other graphing software. Analyze the graph and denote its Big-O somewhere on the graph.

What is the Big-O of binary search?
O(log n)
What is the Big-Ω of binary search?
O(1)
What is the Big-Ө of binary search?
O(log n)
